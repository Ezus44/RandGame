Card game prototype.


Sunduchki (also known as Diplomat) is a logical card game of the non-collectible type. The aim is to collect sets of four cards of the same rank, known as "sunduchs," while guessing cards from opponents using specific questions.

The game can use either a 52-card or a 36-card deck and accommodates 2 to 6 players. The goal is to accumulate more sunduchs than opponents, with the players having fewer sunduchs losing.

Players take turns asking other players questions about their cards. Possible question types include:
Asking about the presence of cards of a specific rank (e.g., aces, queens, sixes).
Asking about the number of cards of that rank (usually a number from 1 to 3).
Asking about the colors of the cards.
Asking about the suits of those cards (requiring enumeration of all suits of that rank held by the questioned player).

If the answer is "no," the asking player draws a card from the deck, and play passes to the next player. If the answer is positive, the active player continues asking questions. 
Upon correctly identifying the exact cards of a specific rank held by another player, they take those cards.
